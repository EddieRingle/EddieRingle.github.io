figured I&#39;d share a solution to an annoying problem I ran into while learning
<a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. The other day, as an exercise, I was porting a prime number
benchmark to get a feel for how Rust handles things like program arguments and
precise timers.</p>
<p>One of the first issues I encountered was in trying to convert arguments passed
to the program as a String to an integer type. In C, this is easily handled
using the <code>atoi()</code> function, so I was dismayed that an equivalently simple
solution was immediately available (or at least, my attempts to peruse the
Rust documentation made it seem that way).</p>
<p>Most of my Google searches led me to the FromStr trait and its <code>from_str</code>
function. Results from early in Rust&#39;s history suggested it was as simple as
C&#39;s <code>atoi()</code>, in that it existed as a standalone function I could call at any
time, with a call to <code>unwrap()</code> chained onto the end:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs rust"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> two: <span class="hljs-keyword">i32</span> = from_str(<span class="hljs-string">"2"</span>).unwrap();</code></pre>

<p>No importing modules or anything special needed. Alas, further Googling began
turning up less and less helpful material. I finally managed to get it working
by importing the FromStr trait and calling the function through it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs rust"><span class="hljs-keyword">use</span> std::str::FromStr;

...

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> two: <span class="hljs-keyword">i32</span> = FromStr::from_str(<span class="hljs-string">"2"</span>).unwrap();</code></pre>

<p>This seemed rather clunky to me, but it worked and I was tired of searching
for any further solution so I stuck to it.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and I stumbled across <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2slr5o">this</a> thread on the
/r/rust subreddit. There, what I presume to be two Rust team members stated
that <code>from_str()</code> had been removed in December, and it was replaced by
<code>str.parse()</code>. I was a little annoyed since the <code>from_str()</code> function is still
documented in Rust&#39;s standard library reference, with no mention whatsoever
that it had been replaced.</p>
<p>Anyways, I present to you what I can only hope is the cutting edge in parsing
strings to integers in Rust:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs rust"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> two: <span class="hljs-keyword">i32</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"2"</span>.parse().unwrap();</code></pre>

<p>How nifty is that? Much better than the mess above, and you also don&#39;t have to
bother with importing any additional modules or traits.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps someone out while they learn Rust as the language itself
arrives at 1.0 (which I trust means we&#39;ll see less of the above insanity soon).</p>
